                    <h3>Hello!</h3>
                    <p>My name is Erman Ramichi, currently 20 year old,student at SS "Cyril and Methodius"-FINKI for Software Developing. I'm from Skopje
                        the capital city of North Macedonia and I live here since I was born. <br> I chose this programme to study for because as a kid I 
                        was always interested in computers and the way how a machine like that would function. Growing up started to learn more about it and
                        to be more interested in and in the end its either 0 or 1 for a computer. :) <br>
                        As everyone I also have hobbies such as playing basketball, playing videogames, editing and manipulating pictures and stargazing. <br><span>
